# Summer of Science (SoS) 2020

This repository contains work I did as part of my Summer of Science (SoS) 2020 project. This was a learning project, and my aim was to learn about various machine learning algorithms, with emphasis on neural networks and deep learning.

As part of the project, I also wrote up a report summarizing nearly everything I learned through it. The report has been included in this repository as [SoS 2020 Final Report.pdf](https://github.com/ankitkmisra/SoS-2020/blob/master/SoS%202020%20Final%20Report.pdf), and it briefly explains several machine learning and deep learning algorithms and techniques.

The two main resources I used for this project are:
1. Andrew Ng's 'Machine Learning' course by Stanford University, on Coursera
2. Andrew Ng's 'Deep Learning Specialization', a series of 5 courses by deeplearning.ai, on Coursera

I have also included in this repository the certificates I earned from Coursera on completion of the above course and specialization. I would also have liked to upload my solutions for the exercises (made using MATLAB, NumPy, and TensorFlow), but I decided against it to avoid violating the Coursera Honor Code.
