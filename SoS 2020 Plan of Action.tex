\section{Learning Objectives}
Through this project, I aim to make myself familiar with various algorithms and techniques related to machine learning and deep learning. To achieve this, I plan to first learn about the basics of machine learning, and then dive into the more specific area of deep learning. Later on, I also plan to learn about the applications of neural networks in the field of Computer Vision.
